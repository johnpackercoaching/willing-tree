# Willing Box - Relationship Growth App

A hybrid PWA for couples to grow their relationships through weekly intentional actions.

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Willing Tree** helps couples create deeper connections through:

- **12-item Wishlists**: Each partner creates wishes for what they'd like from their partner
- **Partner's Wishes ARE Visible**: You can see what your partner wishes for
- **5-item Willing Lists**: Secretly select from your PARTNER'S wishlist what you're willing to do
- **Weekly Guessing Game**: Partners guess what the other was willing to work on
- **Privacy Where It Matters**: Willing selections remain private to preserve autonomy

## 🎮 Complete Game Flow - Step by Step

### Phase 1: Getting Started
1. **Sign Up** → Create account with email and password
2. **Profile Setup** → Enter name, age, gender (helps with AI suggestions)
3. **Pair with Partner** → Send invite via email or share QR code
4. **Partner Accepts** → Both partners are now connected in an "Innermost"

### Phase 2: Creating Wishlists (One-Time Setup)
5. **Create Your Wishlist** → Write 12 wishes of what you'd like from your partner
   - Example: "I wish you would give me a hug when you come home"
   - AI suggests age/gender-appropriate wishes if you need ideas
   - Mark 2 wishes as "Most Wanted" (worth double points)
6. **Partner Creates Their Wishlist** → Your partner does the same
7. **Review Partner's Wishes** → You can now SEE what your partner wishes for
   - This promotes understanding and communication
   - You learn what matters to your partner

### Phase 3: Weekly Cycle (Repeats Every Week)

#### Monday - Selection Day
8. **Select Your Willing List** → SECRETLY choose 5 items from your PARTNER'S wishlist
   - You're choosing what you're willing to work on this week
   - Rank them 1-5 by priority
   - Your partner CANNOT see your selections (privacy preserved)
9. **Partner Selects Too** → They secretly choose from YOUR wishlist

#### Tuesday-Saturday - Action Days  
10. **Work on Your Willing Items** → Throughout the week, do the things you selected
    - No pressure or monitoring from partner
    - Work at your own pace
    - Focus on the items you prioritized

#### Sunday - Guessing & Reveal Day
11. **Guess Partner's Willing** → Look at YOUR wishlist and guess which 5 items your partner selected
    - "I think they were willing to work on these 5 wishes of mine"
12. **Partner Guesses Too** → They guess which of their wishes you selected
13. **See Results** → The app reveals:
    - What you guessed vs. what they actually selected
    - What they guessed vs. what you actually selected
    - Points earned (see scoring below)
14. **Review & Reflect** → Discuss what worked, celebrate efforts

### Phase 4: Continue Growing
15. **Next Week** → Return to Phase 3, Step 8
    - Keep the same wishlists for consistency
    - Select new willing items based on what you learned
    - Build momentum week after week

### Scoring System
- **Correct Guess**: 1 point (2 points if it was a "Most Wanted" item)
- **Partner Guessed You Correctly**: 2 points (4 points if "Most Wanted")
- **Why?** This rewards DOING the behaviors more than monitoring your partner

### What Makes This Special
- **Wishes are visible** → Promotes open communication about needs
- **Willing is private** → Preserves autonomy and prevents coercion
- **Weekly cycles** → Creates sustainable habits
- **Gamification** → Makes relationship work fun and engaging

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Hybrid PWA + Native Apps
```
React PWA (Core) + Capacitor.js (Native Wrapper)
├── Web: Installable PWA with offline support
├── iOS: Native app via Capacitor  
├── Android: Native app via Capacitor
└── Single codebase for all platforms
```

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand + React Query  
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)
- **Payments**: Stripe ($1/month subscription)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor.js for native features
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

## 🔐 Privacy & Scoring Rules

### Privacy Rules (CRITICAL)
- Partners **NEVER** see each other's Willing lists
- This preserves autonomy and prevents prescriptive behavior
- Only your own Willing list is visible to you

### Scoring System  
- **Guesser**: 1 point per correct guess (2 if "Most Wanted")
- **Performer**: 2 points per correct guess about them (4 if "Most Wanted")
- **Incentive**: Rewards performing behaviors over monitoring partner
