# Testing Firebase Integration

## Current Status:
- ✅ Local dev server is running at: http://localhost:5173/willing-tree/
- ✅ Firebase configuration is present in .env.local
- ✅ Firestore rules have been updated

## To Test the App:

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:5173/willing-tree/
2. **Open browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. **Check for errors** in the console

## Common Issues and Solutions:

### If you see "Missing or insufficient permissions":
- The Firestore rules need to be published in Firebase Console
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
- Select your project → Firestore Database → Rules
- Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` file
- Click "Publish"

### If you see "Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found)":
- The Firebase project might not be properly configured
- Check that Email/Password auth is enabled in Firebase Console
- Go to: Authentication → Sign-in method → Email/Password → Enable

### If the page is blank:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### If you see network errors:
- Firebase might be blocked by ad blockers or privacy extensions
- Try in an incognito window
- Check that your Firebase project is active

## Quick Debug Steps:

1. **Check Firebase Auth is enabled**:
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select your project
   - Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Ensure Email/Password is enabled

2. **Check Firestore Database exists**:
   - Firestore Database → Data
   - If it says "Create Database", click it and choose "Start in production mode"

3. **Verify Firebase project is active**:
   - Check project settings
   - Ensure billing is set up (free tier is fine)

## What Should Be Working:

When everything is configured correctly:
1. You should see a login/signup screen
2. You can create a new account
3. Password reset emails should be sent
4. You can log in with existing accounts

## Current Firebase Project:
- Project ID: willing-tree
- Auth Domain: willing-tree.firebaseapp.com
